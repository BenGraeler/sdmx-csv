Open Issues

- What to do with annotations
- how to deal with language requests that cannot be fulifilled for individual items
- decision about the link to the dsd
- for the representation for pivot tables: decide on how to combine id and names into one field, or to put them in seperate fields
- naming: "csv for pivot tables" is too restrictive?
- additional columns are allowed: do we need additional rules for that?
- the results in case of the different REST parameters
