# SDMX-CSV Data Message

SDMX-CSV Data Message is a SDMX data exchange format based on the [RFC4180](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180). CSV is a widely used standardised simple format used to exchange data and is supported by many tools.

SDMX-CSV Data Message works together with the SDMX RESTful Web Services API. It will assist developers to write software that requests data responses in CSV from SDMX RESTful API. The proposed format supports the SDMX 2.1 Information Model and the full functionality of the SDMX 2.1 RESTful API for data queries. SDMX-CSV format is streamable from a supporting web service in order to limit the amount of server resources.
